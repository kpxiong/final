    <img src="tancho.jpg" alt="taisho">
    <p>Taisho Sanke, or Sanke for short, are koi with a solid white base overlaid by patterns of both red and black. It is commonly said that a high quality Sanke pattern begins with a great Kohaku pattern, to which the black is a welcome complement.

        Variations of Sanke include Doitsu Sanke, Maruten Sanke, Tancho Sanke, and Gin Rin Sanke.</p>

    <article>TANCHO</article>
    <img src="tancho1.jpg" alt="tancho">
    <p>Tancho is a hugely popular variation of Kohaku, in which the only red pattern appears as a single red dot on the head. The symmetry and placement of the Tancho mark are main factors in determining the quality of any particular koi. Tancho are highly regarded in the Japanese koi industry for their resemblance to the Grus japonensis, or Red-Crowned Crane.

        Although the Tancho mark can appear in many varieties of koi, the word “Tancho” by itself is almost always used to refer to Tancho Kohaku.

        Variations of Tancho include Gin Rin Tancho and Doitsu Tancho.</p>
